#Changed and not staged. 
#The change is removing the "bad change" that was appended to the README.md file in step k.
The README.md file should now contain what it originally had at step j. We know the change 
is marked because the README.md file is highlighted in green from git status.

PROBLEM 2: (10 points) Pseudocode:

1. Set Input Parameters
   a. LET LIST = DNA_sequence 
   b. LET count_A = 0 
   c. LET count_C = 0
   d. LET count_G = 0 
   e. LET count_T = 0
   f. LET Index = 1 
   g. LET nucleotide_position = LIST[Index]
   h. LET nucleotide_average = ((count_G + count_C)/(count_G + count_C + count_A + count_T))
   i  LET nucleotide_percantage = ((count_G + count_C)/(count_G + count_C + count_A + count_T))*100
   j. LET nucleotide_total = (count_G + count_C + count_A + count_T)

2. Repeat 
   a. If nucleotide_position == "A"
   	Return count_A + 1
      	Else 
      If nucleotide_position == "C"
	Return count_C + 1
 	Else 
      If nucleotide_position == "G"
	Return count_G + 1
	Else 
      If nucleotide_position == "T"
	Return count_T + 1
	Else 
      Go through the loop until last nucleotide in LIST has been through the loop. 
      Index = Index + 1
      Until Index > length(LIST) 

3. Display 
   a. count_A + "As"
   b. count_C + "Cs"
   c. count_G + "Gs"
   d. count_T + "Ts"

   Print "GC% = " + (count_G + count_C) + "/" + nucelotide_total + "=" + nucleotide_average + "=" + nucleotide_percentage + "%"
